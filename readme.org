** Purpose

The idea behind this project was to get some experience using the SPI
protocol and using my MSP430

** Building Project

*Requirements:* 
- TI's open source MSP430-GCC compiler and support files from their website

With the requirements satisfied. It is as simple as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        $ make clean all
        $ make clean all DEBUG=1
#+END_EXAMPLE

(With the latter making a DEBUG build for use with GDB)

** Logic Analyser Traces
  - This section highlights some minor analysis from my [[file:traces/trace_out.sr][captured signal traces]] using sigrok/pulseview
  - For these traces I used sparkfuns SD card breakout board with the Samsung Evo Plus 32Gb micro SD card
*** Init Sequence
    [[file:traces/screenshots/01_overall.png]]
    - CS is held high (inactive)
    - MOSI is also held high (giving 0xFF for the byte transmitted)
    - Generated 12 bytes (96 clocks) of transmission
*** Sending CMD 0
    [[file:traces/screenshots/02_cmd0_transmission.png]]
    - You can see the complete command and response to/from the SD card in the above picture
    - The SD card (SPI mode) decoder is provided to keep the annotations to a minimum
    - The R1 response is 0x01 indicating the card is in an idle state and therefore initialisation was successful
